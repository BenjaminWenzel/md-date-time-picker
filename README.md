## Dependency

### Moment
Why? because parsing dates correctly is not every browser's cup of :tea: and also according to [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard

Moreover, it makes dealing with timezones easier.

ok. Not satisfied with the answer?

Let's take an example:

```js
  new Date('1/10/2016')
```

What should it output? ... well it is interpreted as 1st October 2016 in some browsers and 10th January 2016 in some.

dependencies, from the root of the project:

```bash
npm install
```

After successfully installing the above components

```bash
gulp default
```

Most changes made to files inside the `src` directory will cause the page to reload. This page can also be loaded up on physical devices thanks to BrowserSync.
