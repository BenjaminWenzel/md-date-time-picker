## Dependency

### Moment
Why? because parsing dates correctly is not every browser's cup of :tea: and also according to [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard
Moreover, timezones are also an important aspect of date which is an important parameter.

ok. Not satisfied with the answer?

Let's take an example:

```js
  new Date('1/10/2016')
```

What should it output? ... well it is interpreted as 1st October 2016 in some browsers and 10th January 2016 in some [Refer Me](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse).
