### Build

To get started modifying the components or the docs, first install the necessary
dependencies, from the root of the project:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
gulp all && gulp serve
```

Most changes made to files inside the `src` or the `docs` directory will cause
the page to reload. This page can also be loaded up on physical devices thanks
to BrowserSync.
